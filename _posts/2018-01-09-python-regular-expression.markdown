## Regular expressions are made for processing text.

Lets say you're in charge of compiling a list of contact information for everyone at an event.

Now you've got a text file that is full of names, phone numbers, email addresses, etc. The problem is that some of the data fields have been left empty or entered without any uniformity across the data set.
