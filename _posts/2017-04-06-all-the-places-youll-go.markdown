Over the last 15 years, I’ve been lucky enough to have lived all over the world. I’ve discovered so much about myself, people, culture, and how things work around the world. Since moving to Los Angeles, I’ve been meeting new people, and when we get to talking about travel, I’m asked what my favorite places have been. It got me thinking about all the places I’ve lived, so I’ll start where it all began.

### Chicago, Illinois

Blasted by wind, smothered with snow, plagued with violence, crime, and corruption. That’s usually what people know about Chicago. It’s a hard city and its citizen's rep that with pride. What people don’t much talk about is that living there builds a unique identity. It’s about efficiency, modesty, hard work, and community. They call it a ‘Midwest mindset.’ You take the train, bus, or ride your bicycle to work. And any day you can get authentic food from every flavor of the world. The city has a beautiful blend of so many different cultures.

### Los Angeles, California

I’ve had to describe LA to people from Chicago, and Chicago to people in LA. My girlfriend Arlene and I are still relatively new to Los Angeles, so far the verdict is that the city of LA is ok, but the state of California is fantastic. Traveling and exploring the West Coast is what captivates us about living out here. Everyone drives everywhere. No one walks more than a block for anything, which isolates the neighborhoods. A plus for LA is the food trucks. You don’t have to go to food; it comes to you.

### Okinawa, Japan

Easily one of the most beautiful places I've called my home has been Okinawa Japan. There's a reason it's a blue zone - home to the happiest people expected to live the longest. Island life is something that you can’t explain. It’s just something you have to experience to understand truly.
