Over the last 15 years, I’ve been lucky enough to have lived in 5 countries and it has taught me so much. I’ve learned so much about people, culture, and how things operate around the world. Since moving to Los Angeles, I’ve had to describe LA to people from Chicago, and Chicago to people in LA.

### Chicago, Illinois

Chicago is a city like no other. A midwest mindset drives the community.


### Los Angeles, California

### Okinawa, Japan

And last but not least, easily one of the most beautiful places I've called my home was Okinawa Japan. There's a reason it's a blue zone - home to the happiest people expected to live the longest.
