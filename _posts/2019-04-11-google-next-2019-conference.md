## I attended Google Next 2019 in SF!
Where customers, partners, developers, influencers and the greater global cloud community come to get inspired and learn about Google Cloud Platform, G Suite, Maps, Devices and more great technology and solutions from across Google. Learn from customers and partners, and dive deep through hundreds of breakout sessions, code labs, demos and hands-on training.

Unlock new opportunities for your business by interacting with the entire Google Cloud team, including our engineers, product leadership, developer advocates and more. Plus, you’ll meet lots of other cloud developers and practitioners to share stories and ideas.

We had more than 23,000 people learning at Next ‘18. Take a look at last year’s recap for a peek at what to expect in April 2019.

Next ‘19 will offer more than 500 breakout sessions, led by more than 1,000 Google, customer, and partner speakers. This year, we’ll have even more technical content and learning opportunities. The conference will feature tracks encompassing all aspects of the Google Cloud portfolio: application development, architecture, collaboration and productivity, cost management, data analytics, databases, hybrid cloud, ML and AI, mobility and devices, security, serverless and much more.
