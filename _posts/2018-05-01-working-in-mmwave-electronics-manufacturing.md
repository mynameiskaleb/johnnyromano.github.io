Started working at a millimeter wave (mmWave) manufacturer. This means I'm learning more about physics focusing on electromagnetics, thermodynamics, and wide range of phenomena that impact Radio Frequency Communication devices and it's awesome! But what's mmWave?

### 30 seconds on Radio Frequency (rf)
Electromagnetic waves propagate through free space at specific spectrum ranges allowing for wireless communcation using our atmosphere at as a transmission medium. Or that's to say think of a phone, tablet, or computer connecting to a wireless internet connection. That device has a rf communication module oscillating (operating) at 2.4Ghz or 5Ghz both of which are in the Microwave wave range.

> Oh and yes, microwave like the oven. In 1945, a radar engineer at Raytheon working working on a military project discovered a melted chocolate bar in his pocket after exposure to the radiation. They determined microwave ovens heat food by passing non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation through it. Ionizing radition (Gamma rays, X-rays) which can cause harmful effects like cancer are much smaller 2,400,000 Mhz and on the opposite end of the specturm.

#### Microwave to mmWave - it's the waves actual length!
|Wave type|Operating frequency(Hz)|Wavelength (meters)|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Microwave| 300MHz to 30GHz| 1 to 0.01 meter|
|mmWave| 30GHz to 300GHz|10mm to 1mm|

Get it, millimeter wave.

### So now what's Millimeter Wave (mmWave) used for
The easiest way I've found that it is to understand mmWave is to undersatnd it's use through application.
5G, automotive radar, satellite are some of buzz words currently being thrown around. *NOTE: 5G, not to be confused with 5Ghz, will be operating into the 24 - 77 Ghz millimeter wave range*
