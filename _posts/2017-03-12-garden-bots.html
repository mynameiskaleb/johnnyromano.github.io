<H3>What can we learn about our environment?</h3>
<p>My mission is to make the highest quality environment / weather information available to every person on this planet.</p>
<p><strong>Sensor owners enjoy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Precision: Get weather conditions for your exact location (not your neighbor's or at the airport).</li>
<li>Visualization: See comprehensive dashboards and graphs of your station data.</li>
<li>Historical: Archive your historical data so you can always look back.</li>
<li>Share: Share your data and help us improve weather forecasting for everyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Working together we can DEFINE, MEASURE, and more actively IMPROVE the wellbeing of our communities.
We'll be able to harness the power of data to provide a shared understanding of our community's strengths and
needs, encouraging collaboration among city leaders, local organizations, and residents to improve our
collective wellbeing.</p>
